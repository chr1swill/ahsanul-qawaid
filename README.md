# Local Ahsanul Qawaid

I am learn Arabic from the ground up but have but always forget how to pronounce the letter my teachers teaches me as soon as I get home. But luckily I found the [book online](https://loveforquran.com/files/pdf/course-2/ahsanulqawaid.pdf), and ever for luckily I found the [book online with a native speaker pronouncing all the letters](https://myelm.co.uk/aq-new/index.php).

So thank you Fadheelatush-Sheikh and Shamsuddin Barodwi for the excellent resource. Now that that is our if the way I am putting together my own version that you can run offline. So you can still practice you pronunciation even when you don't have an internet connection.

## Tools

All you need is the [golang compiler](https://go.dev/) and a web browser that supports javascript

## Usage

Super simple just execute the build script it will handle everything for you

```bash
./build.sh
```

Then start your server in the root of this project:

```bash
./bin/main
```

Then go open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in you browser. That's it.

Clicking on any of the letter or words will have the play out loud.

Thanks again to Fadheelatush-Sheikh and Shamsuddin Barodwi.
